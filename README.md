# GUI for LogRhythm Open-Collector (OpenCollector-UI)

Hi there,

This project, is aimed at creating an easy to use Graphical User Interface for LogRhythm Open-Collector.

LogRhythm Open-Collector runs on CoreOS, CentOS (an under RHEL if approved by Product Management), and relies on several components to run (Docker, etc...).
This GUI is designed to make both installation, monitoring and managing the Open-Collector stack easy, as well as authoring and testing custom Filters and Transform in the same App.

Contact me if you would like to be involded.

Cheers,

 Tony
